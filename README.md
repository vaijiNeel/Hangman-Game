# Hangman-Game

Created my first game using HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS animation, JQuery. The Hangman game is themed with Harry Potter - Guess Hogwarts Houses. The game start on document.onKeyup, it displays empty underscores for the word length. When you user types a letter, it captures the key typed using event.key, and if the letter exists in the word it displays on the screen replacing the underscore in the right place where the letter exists in the word. If User types a letter that is not in the word it is displayed in the section "Letters already Guessed". If User types a letter that was already used, the app does nothing.
