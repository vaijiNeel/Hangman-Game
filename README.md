# Hangman-Game

Created my first game using HTML5, Bootstrap CSS, JQuery. The Hangman game is themed with Harry Potter - Guess Hogwarts Houses. The game start on document.onKeyup, it displays empty underscores for the word length. When you user types a letter, it captures the key typed using event.key, and if the letter exists in the word it displays on the screen replacing the underscore in the right place where the letter exists in the word.
